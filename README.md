## _Why not simply put “N” number of text boxes and get it done_

Well, technically you can do that but with a lot of unwanted pain. It’s painless and far better from the experience standpoint.

I faced following challenges with the traditional method :

- I did not want my users to focus into successive boxes without filling the trailing input boxes.
- Witnessed a lag when moved the focus to next/previous sibling boxes upon Input, specially while deleting input backwards.
- Comparatively too many scenario handling resulting in much larger & complex code than this.
